You can:

-   Export to clipboard
-   Save to a file
-   Report on number of consumed IDs vs. total available IDs. This is especially useful for maintaning on-prem licenses, where you can use this consumption report to assign object IDs to the license, and you can see how many objects are left to be assigned.
