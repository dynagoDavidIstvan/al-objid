# YOU SEEM TO HAVE MANUALLY CHANGED THE AUTHORIZATION KEY

AL Object ID Ninja thinks that you have just modified the authorization key in the `.objidconfig`
file.

**If this is the case, then please undo this operation as soon as possible!**

If this is a false alarm (for example, you have switched to a branch that doesn't contain
authorization key, and Ninja failed to detect the branch change), then please ignore this
message.

# So, you changed the authorization key, what now?

If you really changed the authorization key in the `.objidconfig` file, especially if it's
intentional, then it means you don't really know what app authorization is and why Ninja uses it.
We recommend that you read this document:
https://github.com/vjekob/al-objid/blob/master/doc/Authorization.md

Until you undo your changes, you won't be able to assign new object IDs.
