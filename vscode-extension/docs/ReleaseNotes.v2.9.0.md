# Release Notes for AL Object ID Ninja version 2.9.0

Welcome to AL Object ID Ninja version 2.9.0!

## What's New?

This version is mostly about Range Explorer. This is what's new:

-   Go-to-definition action in Range Explorer allows you to jump directly to the relevant section in
    `app.json` or `.objidconfig`.
-   Most icons have been replaced and new color styling was added to communicate range consumption
    status in a more direct, yet less intrusive way.
-   Range Explorer retains its expanded/collapsed state between updates.

Other than this, there are a few less important bug fixes (check the change log for more details).
