# YOU SEEM TO HAVE DELETED THE AUTHORIZATION FILE

AL Object ID Ninja thinks that you have just deleted the `.objidconfig` file.

**If this is the case, then please undo this operation using Git as soon as possible!**

If this is a false alarm (for example, you have switched to a branch that doesn't
contain this file, and Ninja failed to detect the branch change), then please ignore this
message.

# So, you deleted the file, what now?

If you really deleted the `.objidconfig` file, especially if it's intentional, then
it means you don't really know what app authorization is and why Ninja uses it. We
recommend that you read this document:
https://github.com/vjekob/al-objid/blob/master/doc/Authorization.md

The easiest way to recover is to switch to Source Control (**View > SCM** in the main menu), then
find the deletion entry for `.objidconfig`, and then click the **Discard Changes** button.
